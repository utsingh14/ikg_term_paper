# Climate Change Knowledge Graph & Semantic Retrieval

This repository contains the term paper project for the Department of Computer Science Engineering at The LNM Institute of Information Technology (LNMIIT). The project, "Querying Climate Knowledge," focuses on addressing the challenges of unstructured climate data by applying Semantic Web technologies to build a Knowledge Graph (KG) and enable semantic retrieval.

## Methodology

The project's workflow is based on a structured analysis of state-of-the-art knowledge management techniques and a practical implementation pipeline:

1.  **Literature Survey:** A comprehensive review of existing methods for knowledge extraction, KG construction, and semantic retrieval in scientific domains.
2.  **Data Corpus:** The `reddit_climate_data.csv` dataset was used as the primary source of unstructured text.
3.  **Concept Extraction:** An n-gram analysis (unigrams, bigrams, trigrams) was performed to identify the most frequent and significant concepts within the corpus.
4.  **Relation Extraction:** Methods were applied to extract relational triples (subject, predicate, object) from the text, forming the connections within the knowledge graph.
5.  **Analysis & Visualization:** The extracted concepts were visualized as word clouds to provide an intuitive overview of the dataset's focus.
